# 📦 Step 1: Import required libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# 📥 Step 2: Load your uploaded CSV file
# Make sure you uploaded `spam_data.csv` in the left-side panel
data = pd.read_csv("spam_data.csv")
print("🔍 Sample Data:")
print(data.head())

# 🔁 Step 3: Prepare the features (X) and labels (y)
X = data['message']
y = data['label']

# 🔤 Step 4: Convert text to numeric using Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X)

# 🔀 Step 5: Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_vectorized, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 🧠 Step 6: Train the Naive Bayes model
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 📈 Step 7: Predict and evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("\n📊 Model Evaluation:")
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# ✉️ Step 8: Try predicting on new email messages
sample_emails = [
    "You’ve won a free cruise to the Bahamas! Call now!",
    "Hi, just wanted to check in about tomorrow’s meeting."
]
sample_vec = vectorizer.transform(sample_emails)
predictions = model.predict(sample_vec)

# 💬 Step 9: Output the predictions
print("\n🔍 Predictions for new messages:")
for email, label in zip(sample_emails, predictions):
    print(f"Email: {email}\nPrediction: {label}\n")
